`Note: you're not allowed to make any changes to the main branch`

- Copy the files in the branch you wish to work on. 
- Create your own branch representing what you're working on, eg. `git checkout -b kachi-frontend`
- Once you have switched to your branch, pull the code/repo you want to work on, eg. `git pull origin kachi-frontend`
- Make all the changes you want to make
- After making all the changes, add and commit your changes by running the commands;

`git add -A`

`git commit -m 'your commit message comes here`

`git push origin <name of your branch>`

- Then go back to GitHub and create a pull request to the branch you worked on. `Note: you're not allowed to merge the pull request!`
